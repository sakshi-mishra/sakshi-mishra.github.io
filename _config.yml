  desc: "<p>The way electricity is generated, transmitted and consumed is transforming at an unprecedented pace, with the evolution of the grid as a dynamic network. I am an interdisciplinary researcher who loves to work on the nexus of energy systems and artificial intelligence. Infusing todayâ€™s grid with AI to enable its transition to smart grid, by enabling higher levels of renewable penetration, increased reliability, and heightened resiliency - is my goal.</p>
         <p>My hands-on experience in developing solutions for the renewable energy and distributed energy resources integration challenges, my interdisciplinary skill-set (energy + AI), coupled with the multi-national exposure (India, Australia, and the US) uniquely position me to make useful contributions to the energy industry innovations.</p>" 
  greetings: "Hi! I'm Sakshi."
  extra_desc: "<p>I created this website to share my journey in STEM so far including professional experiences and educational background. I also write about my projects that often lie on the nexus of machine-learning and power systems in the blog section. </p>
<p>I believe Artificial Intelligence has to offer a lot to classic power systems sciences to accelerate the pace of global energy transformation and this website if my humble attempt to shed light on the tremendous possibilities [AI + Energy] hold when they come together. </p>"
