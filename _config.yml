  desc: "<p>I am an interdisciplinary applied researcher who loves to work on the nexus of energy systems, blockchain technology, and artificial intelligence. Infusing todayâ€™s grid with advanced intelligence using Blockchain and AI to enable its transition to smart(er) grid, by enabling more clean energy integration, increased reliability, and heightened resiliency - is my goal.</p>"

  extra_desc: "<p>I have created this website to share my STEM journey. </p>
<p>Electricity is the bedrock of modern life - from powering smartphones to computers to electronic appliances - it is knit in the very fabric of life today. Energy systems, that generate and transport electricity, are undergoing a major transformation worldwide. Main drivers being - the urgency to address climate change problems and the technological evolution of the grid as a dynamic network enabling Electrified Transportation, Internet-of-Things, and many more modern technologies. I believe Blockchain and AI have a lot to offer to the classical power systems science for enhancing the effectiveness of this global energy transformation. So, the blog on this website is aimed at sharing my learnings as I continue my quest to innovate blockchain-based solutions for energy systems. </p>"
