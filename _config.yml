  desc: "<p>I am an interdisciplinary researcher who loves to work on the nexus of energy systems and artificial intelligence. Infusing todayâ€™s grid with AI to enable its transition to smart grid, by enabling higher levels of renewable penetration, increased reliability, and heightened resiliency - is my goal.</p>"
  greetings: "Hi! I'm Sakshi."
  extra_desc: "<p>I created this website to share my journey in STEM so far. I also write about my projects, that often lie on the nexus of machine-learning and power systems, in the blog section. </p>
<p>The way electricity is generated, transmitted, and consumed is transforming at an unprecedented pace. Main drivers being - urgency to address climage change problems and the evolution of the grid as a dynamic network serving eletrified transportation. I believe Artificial Intelligence has a lot to offer to the classical power systems science for enhancing the effectiveness of global energy transformation. So, the blog on this website is aimed at shedding light on the tremendous possibilities [AI + Energy] hold, as they come together. </p>"
