# Decentralization in Energy Systems
The electricity sector has primarily been monopolistic dominated by vertically integrated utilities. Liberalization of electricity markets over the past several decades has opened doors only for owners of utility-scale generation plants to participate. From the end user’s perspective, the electricity sector remains largely centralized: end users have very little (if at all) say in market dynamics and therefore they have no choice but to be “price-takers”. The proliferation of DERs, reaching high penetrations, offers a beacon of hope: it empowers the end users and their communities in unprecedented ways toward self-sufficiency to the extent that going “off-grid” is starting to become a viable option. The recent FERC ruling (Order No. 2222) has, opportunely, enabled DERs to participate in the wholesale markets. This rule enables DERs to participate alongside traditional resources in the regional organized wholesale markets through aggregations, opening U.S. organized wholesale markets to new sources of energy and grid services.

The process of decentralizing energy systems needs three-pronged approach - Infrastructure, Policy, and Technology. Economical **DERs installation** is the central constituent of _Infrastructure_ piece, **FERC ruling** is the central constituent of _Policy_ piece, and effective **software** is the central constituent of the _Technology_ piece.

# Blockchain
Blockchain has the potential to empower the _Technology_ piece to carry the information in a tamper-proof manner - thereby opening up the door for peer-to-peer energy transactions. 

In a nutshell - Blockchain is a cryptographically secured distributed ledger which has write once, append only system of storing information. It is distributed in nature and is completely or partially replicated on the peers nodes in the network.

The ability to conduct energy transactions amongst peers, without the need of an intermediary, lays the foundation for the highly decentralized energy systems.
